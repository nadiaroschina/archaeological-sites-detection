DN_SIT0001,Abbad,"Ptolemaic fort located on the Edfu-Berenike road, 22 km from Edfu.",33.08707,25.05003,130,archaeological site,"Ptolemaic fort located on the Edfu-Berenike road, 22 km from Edfu.It has been fully excavated by the MAFDO in 2017-2018.Because of its position (first station for the caravans and expeditions to the Red Sea, when coming from Edfu), the fort of Abbad had a crucial role on the road: it is the place where the members of the caravans gathered, together with their animals, to form the caravan (Crépy, Redon forthcoming). It is also the place where the caravans and expeditions were supplied with water and bread. The fort was equipped with eight bread ovens, a well and two tanks, as well as three outside basins and a supplementary tank.Two buildings functioned with the fort, both equipped with several rooms (3 to 4) and an open-air courtyard; they probably acted as caravanserai, to settle the persons and animals that were temporary gathered at Abbad before their departure to the desert.The 2017-2018 excavations show that the fort was occupied from the end of the reign of Ptolemy II up to the late 3rd c. BC, and abandoned for some decades. Thereafter, it was reoccupied, in the early 2nd c. BC, by shepherds and travelers. A small Roman reoccupation (probably linked with the reopening of the well) occured in the 1st-3rd c. AD, and a most significant one during the 5th and 6th c. BC, when the well was again reopened. This accords well with what is known about the preference for the more northerly route between Koptos and Berenike during the Roman and Late Roman period but is a useful reminder that the route from Edfu was not entirely dormant. It is also striking that 2nd c. BC material was found, that shows that the forts of the Edfu-Berenike road were abandoned and that the Ptolemaic state did not invest in this road again after the Theban revolt, but that it was still in use, by merchands and travelers in the second part of the Ptolemaic era.During the MAFDO excavations, several sandstone blocks with New Kingdom inscriptions, pottery and beads were discovered either reused or under the Ptolemaic fort, and three cartouches of the king Tutankhamen are already mentioned by Lepsius and Green. It is therefore possible that a first settlement, dated to the New Kingdom (and possibly contemporaneous with the equipment of the nearby site of El-Kanais [SIT0094]), was built in Abbad, with a well and maybe a chapel.",fort;unknown;re-occupation;habitation;isolated structure;non-built settlement,"dump, midden;enclosure(s);dwelling;storage silos or rooms;well(s);bakery or isolated bread oven(s);bathing facilities;small reservoir(s);tank(s);inscription(s);scattered pottery;tomb(s);tower(s);cairn(s);other","[""archaeobotanical remains"",""archaeozoological remains"",""bakery or isolated bread oven(s)"",""bathing facilities"",""cairn(s)"",""clothing and shoes"",""dump, midden"",""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""fishing/hunting/husbandry"",""fort"",""furnishings"",""games and toys"",""habitation"",""human remains"",""inscription(s)"",""isolated structure"",""jewellery and ornaments"",""lighting"",""measures, weights, seals, coins"",""musical instruments"",""non-built settlement"",""other"",""pottery (indeterminate function)"",""re-occupation"",""religious object"",""scattered pottery"",""small reservoir(s)"",""storage silos or rooms"",""tableware and serving vessels"",""tank(s)"",""toiletry items"",""tomb(s)"",""tools"",""tower(s)"",""transport and storage vessels"",""transport items and animal tack"",""unknown"",""utility and cooking vessels"",""weaponry"",""well(s)"",""writing tools and related items"",""written material""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT0001

A large building (Building 1, maybe a dormitory) is located in the middle of the settlement. Other buildings (Building 4-5) and a round tomb (Roman?) adjoin it.

Huts and more complex buildings (Rooms 52-63) located in the northeast of the village are arranged in terraces, at mid-slope.

AD, probably as a satellite station of the large Abu Ghusun fort, after its foundation (maybe under Vespasianus?). The fact that the station is very close to Abu Ghusun, and not on the shortest path between Abu Ghusun and Apollonos hydreuma (Abu Qurayyah, 34.5 km to the north-west of Abu Hegilig South), the next station on the Roman road, may be due to the secondary role played by the station of Abu Hegilig South.Its location may be related to the presence of water and/or other resources.Another hypothesis could be that the small station is more ancient than the Roman road. Several pieces of evidence could support this assessment.Inside the enclosure wall are two large tanks. According to the similarity of the station's layout with other Ptolemaic stations, such as Umm Ushra, Seyhrig, Rod el-Logah, or Abu Midrik, the station may have been built in the Ptolemaic period. If that is so then the Abu Hegilig South station would have played the role that Abu Ghusun played in the Roman period on the Coptos-Berenike road, i.e. of a station between the two forts of Apollonos hydreuma and Abu Qurayyah (called Novum hydreuma in the Roman period).Sidebotham 2011b pg. 133 notes the possibility of Late Roman activity here, but this is not borne out by the pottery (J.

One of the hill forts is built near the two forts in the plain, while forts 4 and 5 are between 1 and 2 km to the east, on the northern side of a tributary wadi that leads to the Red Sea mountains.The site is about 25 km NW of Berenike, as the crow flies, at the intersection of two ancient roads, one leading from Berenike to Shealeq, Khashir, Gemal West/Apollonos hydreuma and the Nile Valley, the other to Lahmi and the Red Sea.It was mainly occupied during the Roman period, but the site could already have been in use during the Ptolemaic period, if one considers its strategical location on the final part of the road coming from the Valley and leading to Berenike, which was founded at the beginning of the Ptolemaic period. Some Ptolemaic material may have been recovered in Forts 1, 4 and 5.In the Roman period (1st-2nd c. AD), the two forts in the plain, and the three hill forts were occupied. This dense occupation is not totally understood, since the forts have not been excavated (even though they have been carefully described by the many travelers and missions who have surveyed the site). This may be due to the fact that the forts succeed one another over time. But one could also explain this large number of structures by the fact that the site was home to a large troop, as well as serving as a water supply for Berenike and to the logistics of the caravans approaching and leaving Berenike. Forts 1 and 2 are the largest and probably the place where most of the inhabitants and travelers lived. Forts 3, 4, and 5 may have had a function that was more related to road monitoring.The site of Abu Qurayyah has long been identified with Vetus Hydreuma seemingly mentioned by Pliny HN 6, 26, 103 (see Sidebotham, Gates-Foster 2019, p. 80). However, Cuvigny (2018a, § 140-144) recently proposed identifying the site with Kainon Hydreuma, another fort mentioned by Pliny, the Itinerarium Antonini and the Peutinger Table, and one ostracon found at Xeron Pelagos (O.Xer. inv. 995, fr. c, 15). It is the last stop before Berenike in all these lists. For H. Cuvigny, the toponym vetus hydreuma does not exist. This is a misunderstanding of Pliny's sentence, which should be understood as “Then (one arrives) at New Well, at 236 miles from Coptos. There exists also another well, an old one (hydreuma vetus), which is called ‘Trogodytic,’ where a garrison mounts guard, two miles off the main route.

The following presentation comes from the unpublished report of this visit.The main feature of the site is a circular shaft of nearly 18 m in diameter, still clearly visible, whose perimeter is delimited by blocks. A shaduf was probably located on the east side and the water was then channeled via a pipeline to a series of troughs which follow one another over a length of 50 m from west to east. To the north of the water troughs, 6 animal lines can be seen oriented N/S. In the shelter of the two alignments formed by the water troughs to the N and the pipeline to the W, which form an incomplete enclosure, stands a building consisting of 2 or 3 rooms. Next to it, is a small dump. In the main ""enclosure"", 1, 2 or 3 additional animal lines are visible on the satellite image but they are difficult to see on the site.  Due to the presence of a large well, troughs and animal lines, the site of Abu Shehat has all the characteristics of a station dedicated to supplying water to caravans. These caravans camped there summarily, before moving further into the desert, towards Mons Claudianus or the sea. There are very few constructions that could have sheltered the people passing through, or the inhabitants of the station (the enclosure, if it is indeed one, has only two buildings, one, one-room building, built against the pipe leading from the well to the northern drinking troughs, and the other with two or three rooms, which stands within the enclosure). It is therefore not a classic fortress, like those that equipped the roads from Coptos to Myos Hormos or Berenice, but a simple place to stopover with a well, which allowed the caravans to get water and spend the night.On the toponymy of the site, see below. The site might be identifiable with the ancient Akanthion/Akantha, or, more plausibly, with the ancient site Kampe (""the Bend"").N.B.: the hypothesis put forward by R. and D. Klemm (Klemm, Klemm 2013, pp. 78-79) that the 20 m diameter round structure was a Ptolemaic washery can be refuted. This is the station shaft. Despite the filling of the upper part of the structure with a large volume of eolian sand, the deposit slopes clearly indicate the presence of a deep depression in its centre.

It is at the intersection of the two routes which led to the Porphyrites quarries, the short one, via a zigzag pathway (8 km) through the ""footpath station"", and long one (32 km) via the wadi Umm Sidrah and Abu Maamal, accessible to wagons and large caravans.It comprises a large Roman fort, animal lines and a fortified rock (called Deir el-Badr), of unknown purpose.The material found during the many surveys that have visited the site and the 1990s excavations shows that it was in use when the quarries were operated.

Their foundation is evidence of the growth of the activity and the need for a sophisticated support structure. Then, the fort was probably abandoned (during the whole 3rd c. AD ?) before being massively reoccupied in the 4th c. until the early 5th c. AD (Maxfield 2007, p. 75-80). This period of activity is probably linked with the activity in the Lykabettus quarries. However, the use of the site was also focused on the provision of food and the housing of animals, probably in relation to the Abu Shaar road. At this point, Badia gained an additionnal role as a staging post on this road. The pottery goes up to the early 5th c.

It is well off the Via Claudiana and administered from the Mons Claudianus.The description of Bingen is evocative: ""The few soldiers guarding Tiberiane form a tiny detachment (numerus Tiberianae) of the military contingent (arithmos Porphyritou) that protects the two great quarry tracks and reports to the command stationed at the Mons Porphyrites. The Greek ostraca revealed to us that the caravan which, as we shall see, regularly transports men, food and equipment to the Mons Claudianus via Claudiana, the track coming from the Nile, eventually continues its route to Tiberiane. The impression left by the texts is that the station is no longer a pioneer in the exploitation of the desert but depends entirely on the Mons Claudianus, of which it is now only a satellite station: it is, in fact, in a state of distress for water, food, beasts of burden and in lack of protection against the Bedouins of the desert. Tiberiane returns painfully beyond the end of the world."" (Bingen 2013, p. 10-11).The coarse quartz diorite extracted from the site was called marmor Tibereum (Plin. Nat. 36.55), from the ancient name of the site, Tiberiane. The stone has been identified in the floor of the Domus Tiberiana in Rome (Peacock 1997b, p. 275).A fort is located 500m from the quarries, overlooked by a skopelos. The fort is a parallelogram, with sides of ca 33m in length. It is equipped with four towers, one on each corner (one square, the others are circular). Two more towers flanked the main gate, while another, semi-circular one, is built against the south wall. The inside of the fort is entirely occupied by constructions. It is very similar to the Mons Claudianus' fort and Peacock 1997b, p. 277 proposes that they were designed by the same architect.According to Meredith, there was a bath (impossible to verify due to destruction). A tank is located near the gate, to the right. According to Peacock 1997b, p. 276, there was a well outside the enclosure.Like in the Mons Claudianus, an internal thick wall may indicate that the fort was rebuilt and enlarged (Reddé, Golvin 1987, p. 56).In front of the gate is a trash dump.A necropolis is likely to be located in the NW of the fort, and further to the north, two mainly ruined buildings are recorded, one of which could be a smithy.The site was only discovered in 1943, by Lieutenant R. Bright, as recalled by Peacock 1997b, p. 275. Tregenza draw a first plan, and the most complete one was made by the Mons Claudianus mission that worked on the site in 1992 (survey and small trench, of 3x3m, in the dump).The occupation of the fort is dated to the mid-2nd century AD, and it was abandoned before the late 2nd c. AD. There is nothing, in the trenches opened in the fort's dump, as early as the first century AD, so the fort itself may not be contemporaneous with the initial exploitation of the stone, in the Tiberian period as indicated by the name given to the quarry (Maxfield 2003, p. 158).The quarries are located 500m to the SW of the fort. The lower quarry measures 30m long and two huts are built nearby. Two other quarries are located on the hillside, accessed via a slipway. Finally atop the hill is a cluster of three irregular stone huts and three ""dolmen-like"" structures, maybe for storing water and provisions, unless they were traps (Peacock 1997b, p. 278-279).",fort;extraction site;habitation;isolated structure;other;unknown;tomb(s),"dwelling;dump, midden;bathing facilities;tank(s);well(s);enclosure(s);quarry front(s);tower(s);forge(s);unknown;tomb(s)","[""archaeobotanical remains"",""archaeozoological remains"",""bathing facilities"",""dump, midden"",""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""extraction site"",""forge(s)"",""fort"",""granite"",""habitation"",""isolated structure"",""other"",""quarry front(s)"",""tableware and serving vessels"",""tank(s)"",""tomb(s)"",""tower(s)"",""transport and storage vessels"",""unknown"",""utility and cooking vessels"",""well(s)"",""written material""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT0048

The Ptolemaic activities are linked to Berenike's role in elephant hunting (see Thiers 2001, Sidebotham 2011, Cohen 2006, p. 320, mentioning the famous papyrus P.Petrie 2 40a dated to 224 BC that refers to elephants and Berenike in the same document). The settlement and harbor was located at the end of the Edfu-Berenike road and acted as the southernmost post of the Ptolemaic army, at the fringes of the Empire.

BC, the settlement was reactivated by the Romans. In the Roman and Late Roman period, the city played a critical role in international, regional and local commercial and cultural exchanges between Rome, the Mediterranean, Egypt, India, Africa and Arabia, as shown by the material and texts found on the site.After its final abandonment sometime prior to the middle of the sixth century AD, the site was re-discovered by Belzoni in 1818 and visited several times by scholars of the 19th and 20th c. However, proper excavations did not occur before the end of the 20th c. These were thanks to the work led by S.E. Sidebotham and W. Wendrich (from 1994 to 2001) and then by S.E. Sidebotham and I. Zych (from 2009 onward).It is absolutely impossible to summarize and present the many remains and artefacts that have been brought to light by travelers and archaeologists on the site. Two main period of occupations are distinguished here, since the role played by Berenike during the two period was not exactly the same: the Ptolemaic period, and the Roman and Late Roman period.During the Ptolemaic period, the city was mainly a harbour, equipped to host and repair the boats sent to the African coast in search of elephants. The occupation was probably limited and the remains brought to light are few.During the Roman period, the activity of the city of Berenike increased, and the city was enlarged and adorned with temples, chapels, an arch, etc. The material discovered by Sidebotham's team is incredibly rich and varied. They include documentation of 12 different written languages, varying burial customs, and diverse religious practices and culinary preferences indicating a cosmopolitan population of different ethnicities from various areas of the Mediterranean, Near East, Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, South Arabia and South Asia.",city;habitation;harbor;fort,"chapel(s), temple(s);dump, midden;dwelling;working facilities;storage silos or rooms;tomb(s);enclosure(s);tank(s)","[""archaeobotanical remains"",""archaeozoological remains"",""chapel(s), temple(s)"",""city"",""clothing and shoes"",""dump, midden"",""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""fishing/hunting/husbandry"",""fort"",""furnishings"",""games and toys"",""glass"",""habitation"",""harbor"",""human remains"",""jewellery and ornaments"",""lighting"",""measures, weights, seals, coins"",""navigation"",""religious object"",""storage silos or rooms"",""tableware and serving vessels"",""tank(s)"",""textile and leather"",""toiletry items"",""tomb(s)"",""transport and storage vessels"",""transport items and animal tack"",""utility and cooking vessels"",""weaponry"",""working facilities"",""written material""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT0051

They described the fort, whose gate is built with large blocks of local stone. Purdy copied one inscription engraved on one of the blocks. Colson 1886, p. 526 also mentions the numerous fragments of Greek inscriptions they saw inside the enclosure. G.

The wall is preserved up to 4 m high and 2 m thick where the bluff has a gentler slope.28 rooms are visible, all aligned along the curtain wall. The fort has not been excavated so its chronology and exact purpose (protection of a trade route, of water resources, of mining district, since El-Ileiga is not far) is unknown. However, the paleography of the inscriptions is Hellenistic and the surface pottery is Ptolemaic and perhaps Early Roman (Sidebotham 1996d, p. 372-377).500 m NE of the fort is an ancient well that is still in use, as well as many petroglyphs of different periods (including an elephant and a dipinto in red paint showing an elephant with a rider: Sidebotham et al. 2004, p. 152) and Late Roman pottery (impossible to see on satellite images).",fort,enclosure(s);dwelling;inscription(s),"[""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""fort"",""inscription(s)"",""pottery (indeterminate function)"",""written material""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT0053

It has a well, the Bir Karim (modern, with a double well, gallows, and enclosure, doubled by a recent borehole).The ancient site of Bir Karim includes dozens of dry stone buildings on both sides of the wadi, spreading over more than 600m N/S. Some of them are well built, with large rooms, including a possible chapel in the north settlement.Only one grinding mill was seen on the site during the 2019 MAFDO survey and no gold quartz vein was visible in the vicinity (the only quartz vein seen nearby, by the Quseir el-Qadim project in 1978, contains iron: Whitcomb, Johnson 1979, p. 301).

It was suddenly abandoned before the end of the 3rd c. BC, probably in relation to the Theban revolt uprising.Even though the fort is located near the ancient Ptolemaic gold mining site of Samut North (4.5 km to the north), the exploitation of gold does not appear in the 1,300 or so ostraka discovered in Bir Samut and dated to its main occupation phase, except on two occasions. It was thus primarily a stopover point on the road leading to the Red Sea.Before the construction of the fort, the site was occupied in the early 3rd c. BC in relation to the exploitation of gold in the area (maybe with Samut North?).Reoccupation has also been noted, in the fort and in the surroundings, during the Roman period.

A large well, apparently equipped with an internal staircase, is visible in the middle of the courtyard.Only two soundings were made by the MAFDO in 1996, on the gate and outside Room 24. The material recovered during the excavations is attributable to the second half of the 2nd c. AD (Brun 2003f). The scarcity of the discoveries may evidence a short period of occupation. This is also suggested by the absence of any midden near the main gate (the area has not been destroyed by floods, so this absence is certain).According to Brun 2003f, the plan is original, with no interior rooms at first, before they were added in a second stage. This could have been a caravanserai, before its transformation into a fort. Whatever its function, its main purpose was probably to host a well. The reason for its late construction (the road was equipped in the first c. AD, and reinforced in the early 2nd c. AD) could have been a rationalization effort on the road, because the only stop, between Bir Sayyalah and Myos Hormos, until then was the fort of Nakheil, which was not on the main road, and was only accessible after a detour of more than 10 km. However, the fort of Dawwi was only briefly used, and was quickly abandoned during the 2nd c.

They are located 1.5km from each other.The large fort, located to the SW, measures ca 90 x 80m, i.e. more than 70ha. This is one of the most important forts in the Eastern desert. It is defended by 9 towers, two on each side of the gate (which is to the west), four (one on each of the corners), and one in the middle of the N, E and S walls. A large well (unless it is a tank, as it is sometimes claimed) is very visible in the center of the courtyard. It is protected by a wall and accessed by a staircase. The well is connected to a tank (divided into two parts) by a canalization. The fort is largely covered by sand so the interior rooms are not clearly visible, but they are likely to be built against the curtain wall. At least 8 staircases, that access the parapet of the enclosure,  are recorded by Wilkinson on his plan. Several trenches were opened in the fort by the Berenike project in 1997 and 1998. The surface pottery dates from the 1st-second AD and 5th/6th AD, while the material recovered during the excavations is only dated to the 1st/2nd c. AD. (no later than Trajan) (Sidebotham and Barnard 2000, p. 395-397). The fort was thus quickly abandoned after its construction, probably under Vespasian, like the Siket fort, also located in the vicinity of Berenike.The smaller fort measures 26 x 32m (ext. dim.). It is rectangular and comprises 6 circular towers, two on both sides of the gate and four at the corners. No visible well is recorded by the travellers or the archaeologists that worked on the site. A trench was opened by the Berenike Project in the gate of the small fort of Kalalat in 2000. No dedicatory inscription was found but the material and stratigraphy show that it had only one phase of occupation from the mid-2nd to mid-4th c. AD. Surface pottery may indicate that the site was visited before and after that date, but there are very few sherds.The purpose of the two forts of Wadi Kalalat was probably the developement and protection of a potable water supply for Berenike. However, the two forts were abandoned before the city, maybe because of problems finding water (Haeckl 2007, p. 356). They also formed a defensive ring for Berenike, with a dozen other forts (Sidebotham 2018, p. 11).",fort,"dwelling;enclosure(s);tower(s);dump, midden;well(s)","[""archaeozoological remains"",""dump, midden"",""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""fort"",""pottery (indeterminate function)"",""tower(s)"",""well(s)"",""written material""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT0159

Then the fort was abandoned around 150 AD, and renewed in 176/177 AD (date of the inscription I.Did. 3), the year following Marcus Aurelius' stay in Alexandria. The fort was finally abandoned around 250 AD. The abandonment of the fort was probably linked with the collapse of its well.Between the two phases, several differences are visible in the material and texts (official documents are mainly attested during Phase 2 while private letters are more numerous during Phase 1), as well as in the form of occupation (the outside middens were no longer used at the end of the fort's occupation, rubbish was thrown in the abandoned parts of the enclosure). This could indicate a shift in the administration of the road, which seemed to be more militarized during the first period, while nomads and slaves were more involved in the logistic of the road in the later period.The fort, like many other forts, was still visited by travelers and shepherds during the Late Roman period.For a thorough description, from the MAFDO's 1997-2000 excavations of the fort, see Cuvigny 2011a and 2012b.

It is not situated on an ancient major road (the road from Coptos and Edfu to Berenike passed by El-Khashir and Abu Qurayyah), and probably had another function in the Berenike network than as a road station to the Nile Valley, maybe in relation to the supply of water and security matters.The station seems to have been reoccupied, maybe briefly, in the Late Ptolemaic/Early Roman period, and then abandoned, and Sidebotham 2001b pg. 133 suggests the possibility of 4th c. activity.

The site lies at the extremity of the Edfu-Red Sea road that he and his team surveyed in 1996-1997, which gives weight to this hypothesis, since the majority of the stops on the road are dated to the Ptolemaic period.Eastern Desert Ware was found at Marsa Nakari, which probably shows the presence of Beduin populations (Blemmyes?) on the site (Barnard 2004-2005).The remains attributable to each phase are not easy to distinguish.

Kaine), where grey granite was extracted. The site was discovered by Brocchi, Burton and Wilkinson in 1823. Since then, it has been visited and described by several scholars, who were more interested in the Greek and Latin inscriptions than by the settlement itself. In the 1960s, the German Institute worked there and produced a very accurate plan of the site. Finally Mons Claudianus was thoroughly excavated by an international team led by J. Bingen from 1987 to 1993.The first occupation of the site dates from the Early Empire and probably took place in what is called ""The Hydreuma"" (see SIT1995); the site was already named Claudianus (from the Emperor of the same name), and columns extracted from the site are known of, for example, in the domus Flavia in Rome. After a probable rebirth of the site, under the reign of Domitian (a broken inscription bearing the name of the emperor was found in situ, see Bingen 2013, p. 4), and the discovery of new quarries, with greater extraction possibilities, the site was moved slightly to the east, closer to the new quarries. It comprises, besides the quarries themselves, a large Roman fort, animal lines, a thesauros (""treasure"", i.e. a granary), a temple, and a luxurious residence equipped with baths.The temple was dedicated in 118, under Hadrian's reign, while the architektones Apollonios and Herakleides left several inscriptions dated to 108-109, under Trajan. The reign of these two emperors were the floruit of the quarries' exploitation, and of the site's occupation. Several buildings in Rome, are adorned with columns that originated from the site, including Hadrian's villa.The excavations show that by then the site was exploited intermittently (Mons Claudianus granite was used in the Caracalla baths in Roma, dated to the 3rd c. AD), and visited, if not occupied, until the 4th c. AD.During the work in the Trajanic forum (early 2nd c. AD), about 1000 men worked in the quarries and 300 men are recorded in the middle of the 2nd c. AD (see O.Claud. IV, Appendix 2 and the publication of a list for the distribution of water, describing the people living and working on the site in Cuvigny 2005b).For a thorough description of the quarrying settlement, see the two monographs Peacock, Maxfield 1997, and Maxfield, Peacock 2011, the four books dedicated to the publication of the ostraca (O.Claud.

The site is mentioned by several ancient sources and, according to Strabo, it was founded by Satyros on his way to the Trogodytic country in search of elephants (16.4.5). A Satyros is known at Kanaïs, where he left an inscription dated to the reign of Ptolemy II (I.Paneion 9).The town may be mentioned in the Pithom stela (but Thiers 2001, p. 7 does not mention it).The name of Philotera comes from the sister of Ptolemy II. According to Pliny (NH 6.168), it was also called Aenum.The exact location of the harbour is not known. If one follows the coordinates given by Claudius Ptolemy (although, of course, these cannot be considered to be completely accurate), it is to be found near modern Safaga. Murray 1925, p. 142 proposed, very cautiously, to locate it near the Safaga station, although he did not find any anchorage at this site. He prefers a location at the mouth of the Wadi Gawasis, although he found no remains nor available water there. The creator of the 1:250000 Map, as well as the Tabula Imperii Romani, locate the site accordingly, more precisely, at the place named Marsa Gawasis. Since then it has been proved that the site hosted a Middle Kingdom harbour (see SIT1779 and the Italian Archaeological Expedition at Mersa/Wadi Gawasis).Interesting enough, Tregenza found some Greek fragments in 1951, which led Meredith 1952, p. 105 to conclude that the hypothesis to locate Philotera at Marsa Gawasis was right. This is still the hypothesis of Van Rengen 2001, p. 233-236 for example.Would it be possible that the Pharaonic site was reused by the Ptolemies? It looks like there was a Middle Kingdom occupation at Berenike, so this is likely to have also occurred at other harbours, all the more so that good anchorages are not so numerous on the Red Sea shore.However, no evidence was found during the Italian Archaeological Expedition's excavations at Mersa/Wadi Gawasis and it is thus impossible to precisely locate the harbour (see Van Rengen 2018 for the most recent discussions, in particular p. 12-16).",harbor,,"[""harbor""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT1461

A limited surface has been excavated recently, in the 1970s by the Oriental Institute of Chicago and 2000s by the University of Southampton. Both works proved that the assumption that the site should be identified as Myos Hormos was correct. Indeed for almost a century, the site was wrongly located at Abu Shaar (see SIT0026) which proved to be a Late Roman fort. For Couyat, in 1910, Quseir el-Qadim was an ""Arab port"" (1910b, p. 526), an opinion followed by many scholars after him. Even the Chicago mission was not keen to identify the site with Myos Hormos and proposed an identification with Leukos Limen (see Bargnall 1986). The discovery of eight ostraca by the MAFDO at El-Zarqa/Maximianon gave the definitive argument for the identification (Bülow-Jacobsen, Cuvigny, Fournet 1994, with some previous arguments given by Peacock 1993b), together with ostraca and papyrus found at Quseir el-Qadim afterwards (Peacock et al. 2000, p. 51).The remains excavated by the two missions date mainly to the Roman period, and to the Ayyubid and Mamluk era.However, even if the Ptolemaic remains found on the site are scarce (some fragments of glass, coins of Ptolemy III and VI, and Cleopatra VII, and Ptolemaic pottery, see Van Rengen 2018, p. 5), ""Myos Hormos is undoubtedly a Ptolemaic foundation, because the port is mentioned by Agatharchides of Knidos (second half of the second century BC)."" (Van Rengen 2018, p. 2). ""The port enjoyed substantial growth during the Augustan era: 120 ships left each year for India and Arabia (Strabo 2, 5, 12)."" (idem) and indeed the first traces of occupation date back to the late 1st c. BC and with particular intensity in the 1st c. AD. Then the site was abandoned in the mid-3rd c. AD, and reused as a harbour in the 12th-15th c. AD. The Islamic occupation was not as large as the Roman one and even if the ancient site has suffered from the proximity of the sea and the reoccupation, the remains are preserved well enough to reconstruct the history of the city, if not its layout (the excavations were too limited to do so).It showed that the lagoon was used as an inner bay and linked to the sea through a channel. The waterfront was set out with dozens of amphorae (Dressel 2-4 dated to the 1st c. BC/1st c. AD, see Blue 2009, p. 271-274) set vertically in the silt and covered with earth, as well as stone-built jetties. Several buildings were excavated in the town itself, in particular a significant building in the centre of the town, maybe a temple, a ""Roman villa"", in the NW part of the town, but also more common houses (see Whitcomb, Johnson 1979 and 1982a). The materiel is abundant and proves the insertion of the harbour in the Red Sea networks (and beyond). Besides, the numerous ﬁnds related to shipbuilding activities, and ﬁshing also show the dynamism of the city as a harbour (Thomas 2012, Blue 2009).In his journal (De Castro 1541), Joan de Castro  wrote that ""in old times, the town of Kossir was built two leagues farther up the coast; but being found incommodious, especially as the harbour at that place was too small, it was removed to this place (Quseir).""

Some of them, in the south part, are very well-built and exceptionally well-preserved, up to 3m high. These buildings have their lintels, windows and niches preserved. Some of them have courtyards.To the north of the settlement, the buildings are much simpler huts. Besides this, hundreds of tombs have been recorded near the lower settlement (see Barnard 1998).Eight trenches were opened by the Berenike project in 1997.The pottery found in the village by the Berenike Project is dated to the Late Roman period (5th-early 6th c. AD). In the fort, the pottery dates to the late 1st c. BC/early 1st c. AD (Cappers 2006, p. 18).Surface water is present in abundance according to Cappers 2006, p. 18-19 (see fig. 1.7) and Aldsworth 1999, thanks to the narrowing of the wadi and the shallow sand layer, which would allow agriculture.The function of the settlement is unknown. The difference in chronology between the fort and the settlement raises many unsolved questions (see Jackson 2002, p. 92).It should be concluded that the fort was built at the same time as the large fort of Kalalat and the fort of Siket, and then abandoned at the same time as the large fort of Kalalat. Its purpose was to protect the city and maybe the trade roads leading to it.Then the site was abandoned and only re-occupied in the Late Roman period, which was the apex of the occupation of Berenike. During that period, the function of the settlement is unknown, although it should be stressed that its location recalls the location of Karim, in the hinterland of Myos Hormos, which was maybe dedicated to supplying water to the harbour. The variety of artefacts found during the excavations (in particular saphir from Sri Lanka, pepper from India, the many seeds and vegetables studied by Cappers 2006, as well as teak, beads, sorghum from India, olives, almonds, umbrella pines from the Mediterranaen) indicate that the population of Shenshef was wealthy (see for a summary Sidebotham 2011a, p. 275-276).",fort;habitation,"enclosure(s);dwelling;surface water harvesting structure(s);dump, midden","[""archaeobotanical remains"",""archaeozoological remains"",""clothing and shoes"",""dump, midden"",""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""fort"",""games and toys"",""glass"",""habitation"",""jewellery and ornaments"",""lighting"",""measures, weights, seals, coins"",""pottery (indeterminate function)"",""religious object"",""surface water harvesting structure(s)"",""tableware and serving vessels"",""textile and leather"",""transport and storage vessels"",""weaponry""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT0190

It was studied by the German mission in the 1960s and again by Peacock in 1992, who drew the first plan after Wilkinson. It has never been excavated, except in 1993, when four small trenches were dug in the trash dump and in the village by J.-M. Carrié, with H. Cuvigny (Carrié 2001).The site comprises a small fort occupying a dominant position on a rocky promontory, irregularly organised buildings at the foot of the fort that could be the remnants of a workers' village, and finally a large building built on a terrace, identified by Lepsius as the commandant's house.The pottery is mainly Trajanic, as well as the ostraca, like the Mons Claudianus. But one trash dump associated with the village yielded an ostracon dated to the reign of Nero (AD 68, MC inv. H44) on one layer dated to the second phase of the occupation. The site is thus likely to be more ancient than the Mons Claudianus main site, maybe a first attempt that was later supplemented by the larger fort (Peacock 1997c, p. 148). This could explain the name of the quarry, which refers to the Emperor Claudianus (Carrié 2001, p. 166). Indeed the ostraca also show that the site was called Mons Claudianus.The reconstruction of the southern part of the village may date to the reign of Trajan and could be named Fons Traianus Dacicus, according to Carrié 2001, p. 166-167.(based on Peacock 1997c and Carrié 2001).",fort;habitation;place of worship,"enclosure(s);dwelling;tank(s);dump, midden;small reservoir(s);chapel(s), temple(s)","[""archaeobotanical remains"",""chapel(s), temple(s)"",""dump, midden"",""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""fort"",""granite"",""habitation"",""place of worship"",""pottery (indeterminate function)"",""small reservoir(s)"",""tank(s)""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT1995

The lower part was dug in the substrate and provides water: the well's recharge is therefore based on the deep fractured aquifer. Water was in the bottom of the well during our visit. The SW corner of the fort appears to have been disturbed by flooding.The Late Roman settlement is composed of about 300 huts, very variable in size and shape, built on both sides of the wadi Diqal, where the Late Roman well and the Umm Diqal enclosure stands, and in a tributary to the south.

Its main period of occupation was the 5th and 6th c. AD.However, the site was occupied long before then. In particular by a Roman fort and settlement called Persou (or Persou kai Tamostymis, see below) in the ostraca, built during the first century AD. It was renown for its gardens where vegetables and herbs were grown and were sent to the other forts of the area. This peculiarity comes from the presence of high quantities of water.The fort has now totally disappeared. According to Henry Wright, it was near the modern mosque (Meyer 1994, p. 43), while A. Reinach thinks it was near the well.The ostraca O.Faw. comes ""from a dozen of huts located near the mines"" (Guéraud 1942, p. 143, 148). Apart from 3 ostraca that may be more ancient, the other ostraca found at Umm Fawakhir and published by Guéraud are dated to the reign of Trajan and Hadrian. However, the Roman station is more ancient, as proven by a letter sent by the curator of the praesidium to Koptos in 55 AD (O.Petrie Mus. 112), and a document found at Umm Fawakhir and dated to 40/42 AD with a clear military context (O.Faw. 14 = SB 6 9017 14).The Roman station was probably called Persou (like the small village located 5km to the west) and Tamostymis (or Persou kai Tamostymis), which could be its Ptolemaic name (see Cuvigny 2003, p. 281-282).Indeed, the existence of a settlement dated to the Ptolemaic period at the same place is probable. This is deduced from the presence of a possible temple of Min dated to the reign of Ptolemy 3, and an ostracon of the 3rd c. BC (see the subsite for more details).",habitation;non-built settlement;fort;place of worship;extraction site;rock shelter,"dwelling;mine vein and trenches;well(s);working facilities;enclosure(s);chapel(s), temple(s);quarry front(s);inscription(s)","[""chapel(s), temple(s)"",""dwelling"",""enclosure(s)"",""extraction site"",""fort"",""gold"",""granite"",""habitation"",""inscription(s)"",""mine vein and trenches"",""non-built settlement"",""place of worship"",""quarry front(s)"",""religious object"",""rock shelter"",""well(s)"",""working facilities"",""written material""]",https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/sites/DN_SIT0215
